We developed a model to predict likelihood of default on loan.

The Lending Club dataset contained 42,514 borrower's records and 20 variables which comprised borrower's demographics, credit status, behaviour and loan details

Modelling was performed using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and neural network. Bagging and boosting were also applied to the baseline models to enhance model performance.   

Models were evaluated based on ROC-AUC, precision and recall.

Logistic regression was recommended as it provided reasonable accuracy and was suitable for use in a regulated finance industry.
