Welcome to my GitHub Page!

Hi Everyone, I am Alvin Chia. I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Master degree in Enterprise Business Analytics and a Bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering.  

I strive to develop a career in data science and business analytics where I can leverage on data to derive insights, apply modelling techniques to predict future trends, and prescribe recommendations to stakeholders to make business decisions for strategic growth.

This blog documents my work in the areas of data science and business analytics.
