Oct 19: Our team built a book recommender system using the goodreads book dataset.

Instructions: Select the book genre, author, title and rating (optional). 

Books recommendations will be provided based on (1) top rated books, (2) books with similar content or (3) books rated by readers with similar preference.  

[Try it out!](https://nelsonljs.shinyapps.io/demo_project/)
