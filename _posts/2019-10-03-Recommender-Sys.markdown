Our team built a book recommender system using the goodreads book dataset.

Books recommendations will be provided based on (1) top rated books, (2) books with similar content or (3) books rated by readers with similar preference.  

[Try it out!](https://nelsonljs.shinyapps.io/demo_project/)

Instructions: 
Select the book genre, author, title and rating (optional).
