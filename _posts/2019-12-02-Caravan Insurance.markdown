We developed a propensity model to cross-sell caravan insurance.

Our objective was to improve sales of caravan insurance by cross-selling caravan insurance to the client's existing customers through customer segmentation and targeting.

Tasks involved were cluster analysis (k-medoids clustering) and propensity modelling (logistic regression).
