We developed a propensity model to cross-sell caravan insurance using the Insurance Company Benchmark (CoIL 2000) Caravan dataset.

Our objective was to improve insurance sales by cross-selling caravan insurance to the client's existing customers through customer segmentation and targeting.

Tasks involved were (1) dimension reduction using principal component analysis to extract the principal components that best explain our customers' behaviour in purchasing insurance policies, (2) cluster analysis (k-medoids clustering) to segment our customers into groups and (3) propensity modelling to develop a scorecard (using logistic regression) and recommending the top bins in the clusters for the marketing campaign.
